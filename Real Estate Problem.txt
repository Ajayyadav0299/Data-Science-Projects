Price of a property is one of the most important decision criterion when people buy homes. 
Real state firms need to be consistent in their pricing in order to attract buyers .
Build a predictive model for the same will be great tool to have , which in turn can also be used to tweak development of properties , putting more emphasis on qualities which increase the value of the property.


Given two datasets , housing_train.csv and housing_test.csv . Use data housing_train to build predictive model for response variable "Price". Housing_test data contains all other factors except "Price", you need to predict that using the model that you developed and submit your predicted values in a csv files.


Evaluation Criterion : 

Score will be calculated as:

Score = 212467/RMSE Where RMSE is root mean square error on test file. 

Score for test data should come out to be more than 0.51

predictions should not contain any NA values
